Crucible Intel: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Crucible Intel app for Android!

This is a simple Android app developed by George McBay.  

With this app you can type bungie.net Destiny 2 player names into the app to view the recent PvP history of those players as returned by the bungie.net API.  

The app does not retain or transmit any personal information about the user and only acts as a conduit to the bungie.net API.
